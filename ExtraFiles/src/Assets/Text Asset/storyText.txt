You find yourself in a dark lifeless room. You can hear insects chattering in the shadows.
You received your assignment sheet, the world looks fresh and new outside.
You have left the dark room and you are unsure how much time has past.
You see that the world around you is too, abandoned.
The monsters are trying to get into your head.
Seemingly pointing a vector to you should see the world. Your sheet is blank.
What is with this world? You wonder. Empty. Grim.
It continues to try get into your head. Your sheet is blank.
The books here mock the player, the insects chatter and laugh.
The book mocks the player further. This time showing how pathetic collecting it is.
Your sheet is still blank. Soon you'll come to realise.

Due date is drawing closer, but not enough to set panic.
For something lurks behind the cracks. Something that you may have forgotten.
